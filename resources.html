  <h4>The situation surrounding education:</h4>

  <h5>Education is one of the most important things we have, but there are thousands of people who lack literacy, and other forms of basic education. 
<br>
      There are many reasons for the education situation: including corrupted governments, poor families, bad schools, etc. In many  countries, the 
      <br>
      goverment funds well maintained public schools, but in many third world and some first world countries, due to the government corruption, public 
    <br>
      schools are not in good shape. For richer families, this does not affect them much due to them joining private schools witha high tuition cost. 
    <br>
      On the other hand poorer families, who lack proper funding, will have to stick with the government funded school. Adding on to this, many students
    <br> need to be transported for long periods of time to go to school, not having a school in their town! Families with a long line of people
    <br> 
    with the same career path, such as fishing, will discourage their children from school, to learn the family practice. The cycle might not end 
    <br>as the kids grow up and do the same thing to their children. A good education can lead to so many benefits for the individual and the 
    <br>community as a whole. Decreasing the wealth gap, more stable and safe economies, booming innovation, and maybe the cure for cancer!</h5>
